/*Given the length of two sides of a triangle and the size of the angle between the two sides, the length of 
the third side can be calculated from the Cos Rule: a2=b2
 + c2
 â€“ 2bc Cos A. Other angles can also be 
calculated from the sine rule, which is . Furthermore, the area is calculated as 
Write a program that allows the input of two sides of a triangle and the angle between the two sides 
and it displays the length of the 3rd side, the remaining angles as well as the area of the triangle.*/
